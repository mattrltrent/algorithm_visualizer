   ```


## Usage

1. Upon running the program, you will be presented with a grid-based environment.
2. Select a start node by selecting the green icon and clicking on any cell.
3. Select a target node by selecting the red icon and clicking on another cell.
4. Add obstacles by clicking and dragging the mouse across the grid.
5. Choose the desired pathfinding algorithm from the options menu.
6. Click the "Start" button to begin the visualization.
7. Observe the algorithm's progress as it attempts to find the optimal path.
8. Adjust the speed control to modify the animation speed.
9. Reset the grid and start over by modifying the grid or pressing the "Run Algorithem" button again.
